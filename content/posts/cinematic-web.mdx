# The Cinematic Web

The web is evolving. It's no longer just about information; it's about experience.

## Why Choreography Matters

When elements enter the stage at the right moment, it creates a sense of rhythm.

```tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
>
  Hello World
</motion.div>
```

This is a code block. We can also render components.

<Callout>
  This is a custom component inside MDX!
</Callout>
<iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/152b6067"></iframe>
