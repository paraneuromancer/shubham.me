The Percentage Manifesto

I do not manage time in hours.
I manage it in percentages.

Every day begins with 100%.
Once spent, it is gone.

I do not wait for motivation.
I allocate.

I do not overestimate what a day owes me.
I respect its limits.

Small percentages compound.
Neglected percentages decay.

If something matters, it earns a percentage.
If it doesn’t, it is removed without guilt.

Distraction is not evil -
it is simply expensive.

I protect my 10%.
I honor my 1%.

Progress is not dramatic.
It is arithmetic.

This is how I reclaim ownership of my days.
This is how potential becomes real.
