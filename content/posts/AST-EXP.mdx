## ACE Engineering Academy Scholarship Test (AST NOV 2025)

I just sat for the ACE Engineering Academy Scholarship Test (AST NOV 2025), and I want to share what actually showed up, just the breakdown that would've helped me prepare better.  
Here's the reality: This isn't your typical multiple-choice exam where you can guess your way through. It's a well-designed filter that tests whether you have the fundamentals solid enough to build on.

## What I Encountered

The exam has alot of questions spanning three main areas:

### Mathematics (The Heavy Hitter - ~70%)

This dominated the paper. I faced:

- Ratios and percentages (A:B:C type problems)
- Geometry (angle bisector theorem, embedded figures)
- Complex numbers (modulus calculations)
- Calculus (partial derivatives, differential equations, integrating factors)
- Statistics (Poisson and binomial distributions)
- Number series (letter-cluster patterns, progressions)

---

### Logical Reasoning (~20%)

- Spatial reasoning (which figure contains this shape?)
- Pattern recognition
- Code language problems (simple substitution)
- Relationship puzzles (family trees, "who is who")

---

### Verbal (~10%)

- Synonyms (e.g., "erstwhile" = "former")
- Antonyms (e.g., "magnanimous" ≠ "petty")

## What Surprised Me

1. The questions weren't trying to trick me. They were straightforward applications of concepts. If you know the angle bisector theorem, you'll solve that geometry problem. If you know the integrating factor formula, you'll get that differential equation.

2. Linear algebra showed up (rank, consistency of systems)—something I almost skipped in my prep.

3. Speed matters as much as accuracy. Simple calculations should not eat up minutes.

## The Bottom Line

> This exam rewards conceptual clarity over memorization. You need to recognize which formula or theorem applies, then execute cleanly.
